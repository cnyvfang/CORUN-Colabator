[//]: # (**Abstract:** Real-world Image Dehazing &#40;RID&#41; aims to alleviate haze-induced degradation in real-world settings. This task remains challenging due to the complexities in accurately modeling real haze distributions and the scarcity of paired real-world data. To address these challenges, we first introduce a cooperative unfolding network that jointly models atmospheric scattering and image scenes, effectively integrating physical knowledge into deep networks to restore haze-contaminated details. Additionally, we propose the first RID-oriented iterative mean-teacher framework, termed the Coherence-based Label Generator, to generate high-quality pseudo labels for network training. Specifically, we provide an optimal label pool to store the best pseudo-labels during network training, leveraging both global and local coherence to select high-quality candidates and assign weights to prioritize haze-free regions. We verify the effectiveness of our method, with experiments demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art performance on RID tasks.  )

## üî• News
```
‚ö†Ô∏è We found that the previous installation script installed an incorrect version 
of PyTorch and Numpy, which led to erroneous experimental results. Users who used
the repository code before 2024-10-23 should reconfigure the environment using the
new script, and ensure that PyTorch version 2.1.2 is installed.
```
- **2024-11-06:** We fix some bugs in the code and support the single GPU training now. üêû
- **2024-10-26:** Our results and pre-trained weights have been released! ‚ù§Ô∏è
- **2024-10-23:** We are processing the camera-ready version of this paper, the pretrained weights and test results will be released soon.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Dependencies and Installation

### Datasets

- **RTTS** dataset can be downloaded from [Dropbox](https://utexas.app.box.com/s/2yekra41udg9rgyzi3ysi513cps621qz).
- **URHI** dataset can be downloaded from [Dropbox](https://utexas.app.box.com/s/7hu094vwkw0cwowv5wijwv9pure2fvup).
- **Duplicate Removed URHI** can be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B29LsNhBWoRHDk2R_cc5nNqcn7c87sg-/view?usp=sharing)
- **RIDCP500** can be downloaded from [RIDCP's Repo](https://github.com/RQ-Wu/RIDCP_dehazing)

We provide two types of dataset loading functions for model training: one **loads clean images and corresponding depth maps to generate hazy images** using the RIDCP Data Generation Pipeline, and the other **directly loads paired clean and degraded images**. You can choose the appropriate method based on your dataset and task.

**For the haze generation method**, we support reading the RIDCP500 dataset (where depth maps are stored as .npy files) as well as the OTS/ITS datasets (where depth maps are stored as .mat files). If your dataset contains paired clean images and depth maps, you can also use your own dataset. If your dataset does not include depth maps, you can generate corresponding depth maps using methods such as RA-Depth.
**For the paired degraded-clean method**, you can use any paired degraded-clean image pairs for training and testing.

### Initialize Conda Environment and Clone Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cnyvfang/CORUN-Colabator.git
conda create -n corun_colabator python=3.9
conda activate corun_colabator
# If necessary, Replace pytorch-cuda=? with the compatible version of your GPU driver.
conda install pytorch==2.1.2 torchvision==0.16.2 torchaudio==2.1.2 pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia

```

### Install Modified BasicSR
```bash
cd basicsr_modified
pip install tb-nightly -i https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple # Run this line if in Chinese Mainland
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py develop
cd ..
```

### Install Our CORUN-Colabator
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py develop
python init_modules.py
```
üö© If you are in China Mainland, run the script before init_modules.py to speed up the download of the pre-trained models:
```bash
export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com
```

Download the pre-trained da-clip weights and place it in `./pretrained_weights/`. You can download the daclip weights we used from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bIlKYouxwizQXbud7SXd5F5oOyoHFH4x/view?usp=sharing). You can also choose other type of clip models and corresponding weights from openclip, if you do this, don't forget to modify your options.


## üèÉ Train
‚ö†Ô∏è **Please replace the dataset path in the options file with your own dataset path.**
### Pretrain CORUN
```bash
# Multi-GPU
sh options/train_corun_with_depth.sh
# Single-GPU
sh options/train_corun_with_depth_single_gpu.sh
